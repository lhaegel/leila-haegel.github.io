I will be at CERN on November 19th for [Dance with Evolution](https://visit.cern/node/7616), an event gathering the paleotanthropologist Pascal Picq, the dance company Hallet Eghayan and myself to discuss the origins of humanity, the Universe as we know it, and how we progress on the knowledge and experience of both. Registration is [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1466099/registrations/110269/).
