Welcome to my website!

I am a research associate in Statistics at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics][MathsStats] at the [University of Glasgow][UoG], working with [Dirk Husmeier][DirkHusmeier] on computer-intensive statistical inference in soft-tissue mechanical models based on partial differential equations. My current post is within the EPSRC funded [Closed-Loop Data Science][CLDS] centre, where I work on incorporating feedback effects into healthcare prognostication systems. My previous position at Glasgow was within [SofTMech][SofTMech], an EPSRC centre for Multiscale Soft Tissue Mechanics with applications to heart and cancer.  

I did my PhD at the [Department of Econometrics and OR][EOR], [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam][VU], and the [Tinbergen Institute][TI]. I was working [Siem Jan Koopman][SiemJanKoopman] and [Lennart Hoogerheide][LennartHoogerheide] on developing methods for accurate and efficient Bayesian inference for time series analysis, with a particular focus on applications in econometrics and finance.  In Spring 2017 I visited [Ruth King][RuthKing] at the [School of Mathematics][SchoolMath], the [University of Edinburgh][UoE], to work on efficient algorithms for Bayesian inference in state space models.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics][MIMUW], the [University of Warsaw][UW], and a Master's degree in Economics from the [Warsaw School of Economics][SGH].



#### My main research interests:

* Bayesian methods
* Monte Carlo methods (MCMC, SMC, ABC)
* Time series analysis (especially state space models)
* Data analysis (including rare event estimation)
* Machine learning (e.g. Bayesian optimisation)

Besides, I am interested in code optimization, deep learning and adaptive importance sampling.
