Hi, I am Le√Øla Haegel, a researcher at the [Institute of Physics of the 2 Infinities](https://www.ip2i.in2p3.fr/?lang=en) of Lyon, France.

My field of research is particle physics, and how the properties of fundamental constituents of matter give us indications about the laws of nature and the content of the Universe.

I am specialised in neutrinos, the most elusive and mysterious of all the fundamental particles.
I am a member of the [DUNE collaboration](https://www.dunescience.org/) in which we build large-scale liquid argon detectors to study neutrino oscillations. 
#In particular, I am interested in the following question: 
#- is there CP violation in the leptonic sector and if yes, is it linked to the abundance of matter over antimatter in the Universe? 
#- can we measure the neutrino mixing matrix unitarity and get insights on the number of generations in the Standard Model? 
#- how well can we detect little-observed tau neutrinos, and how can they help answer the question above? 
#- how well can we reconstruct neutrino properties in our detector to answer all those questions?  

More details about my research are available on my [publications](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1348388).

For collaboration, internship, thesis or postdoctoral position, please [contact me via e-mail](https://annuaire.in2p3.fr/6470-11492/leila-haegel).
